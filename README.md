# Civilization VI Türkçe / Turski / Turkish

This project will be a translation of Civilization VI into Turkish. The goal is to provide a complete translation of the game, including all expansions and DLCs.

Currently, all translations are AI generated, using GPT-4o and GitHub's Copilot, and translated from the Finnish language, and from few English strings.
